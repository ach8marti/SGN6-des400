      "Victim was found collapsed near the back gate of the university dorm at 2:14 AM. Hours before, she messaged the dorm group chat saying she felt followed, but no one replied. The message remained unread as she was later discovered unconscious beside her phone.",

      "At 1:53 AM, the security guard found her unconscious in the meeting room. Her office phone kept receiving messages from the ‘Project-Final’ group. You've been granted temporary access to her device — the truth is somewhere in that chat history."
